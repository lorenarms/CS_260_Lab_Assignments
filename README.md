<h2>CS-260 Portfolio in C++</h2>

This is a portfolio of applications written for my CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms class. These applications explore the various structures used to store data, such as vectors, linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables. All applications are written in C++.

Each application's folder contains a PDF explaining the requirements of the project, as well as a Word document that explains the application. The Word documents also contain a flow chart that was written for the development of the application. 

For the final project, I was only required to compile my 'favorite' applications developed during the class; however, I took my favorite of the apps (Hashtable) and refactored it to include some extra features. One such feature is an interactive console menu of my own design, written as a separate class designed to be injected into any other C++ application in need of a navigation menu. This hashtable application also includes chaining for collision avoidance. 

The CSV parser file is provided from another Git user, it's documentation is included in the files.
